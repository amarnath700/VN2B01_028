"""
string:
    Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
'hello' is the same as "hello".

Strings are Arrays:
strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.
However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.
Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.

String Slicing:
You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.
Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[:5])
