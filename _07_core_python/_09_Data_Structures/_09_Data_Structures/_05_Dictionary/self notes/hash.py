"""
Hashing is a method of indexing and sorting data.
The idea behind hashing is to allow large amounts of data to be indexed using keys commonly created by formulas.
This is done by taking the help of some function or algorithm which is called
a hash function to map data to some encrypted value which is termed as “hash code” or “hash”.
