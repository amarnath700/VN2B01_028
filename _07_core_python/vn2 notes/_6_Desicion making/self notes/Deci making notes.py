"""
Decision-making is anticipation of conditions occurring while execution of the program and specifying
actions taken according to the conditions.
Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE or FALSE as outcome.
You need to determine which action to take and which statements to execute if outcome is TRUE or FALSE otherwise.
Python programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as TRUE, and if it is either zero or null,
then it is assumed as FALSE value.



if statements:
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements
The if statement contains a logical expression using which data is compared and a decision is made
based on the result of the comparison.

Syntax:
if expression:
   statement(s)
