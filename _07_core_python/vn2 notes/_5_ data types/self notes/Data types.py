"""
Built in types:
In programming, data type is an important concept.
Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memory view
"""

"""
By using print() function we retrieve the data or result in console.
By using type() function we get data type of value.
By using id() function we get the reference address of value.
Ex:
"""
print("--------- Example of 3 function print(), type(), id() ----------")
x = 100
print(x)
type(x)
id(x)

"""
Numeric Type:
In numeric there are 3 data types. int,float,complex 
int     - from -n to n all numbers with out decimal value are integer
float   - numbers with decimals are float
complex - number are end with "j" either with decimal or without decimal  are complex
EX:
"""
print("--------- Example of 3 Numeric types int, float, complex ----------")
x = 100
print("Integer value is:", x, type(x), id(x))

y = 10.12
print("Float value is:", y, type(y), id(y))

z = 10j
print("Complex value is:", z, type(z), id(z))

#  conversions
a = 20.5
x = int(a)
print("Integer value is:", x, type(x), id(x))

y = float(x)
print("Float value is:", y, type(y), id(y))

z = complex(y)
print("Complex value is:", z, type(z), id(z))

"""
Important
y = "amar"
a = complex(y)
print("Complex value is:", z, type(z), id(z))
"""

"""
Text type:
 if we give  value to a variable with in  double quotation is known as sting
 ex: "python language", "100", "565sfd"
 """

print("--------- Example of String ----------")
x = "100"
print("value is:", x, type(x), id(x))

x = "111.11"

x = "Amarnath"
print("value is:", x, type(x), id(x))

a = 20.5
x = str(a)
print("String value is:", x, type(x), id(x))

x = 5555
y = str(x)
print("String value is:", y, type(y), id(y))

y = 546j
z = str(y)
print("String value is:", z, type(z), id(z))

"""
Boolean type:
In Boolean there are 2 value true and false
when given value is equal to ' 0 ' in boolean it is false.
Except ' 0 ' all are true.
EX:
"""

x = 0
y = bool(x)
print("value is:", y, type(y), id(y))

x = "Amar"
y = bool(x)
print("value is:", y, type(y), id(y))

"""
Sequence types:
List -Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data.
the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
Lists are created using square brackets:[10.20.30."amar",[1,2,3]]


Tuple - Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data. 
the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
Tuples are written with round brackets: (10, 20, "Amar")
"""

a = tuple(x)
print("value is:", a, type(a), id(a))

"""
Dictionary
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:
"""
e = {a: 20, y: 100, "name": "Amar"}
print("value is:", e, type(e), id(e))

"""
set type:
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data.
the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and un-indexed.
* Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.
Sets are written with curly brackets. {10,20,30,"amar"}
