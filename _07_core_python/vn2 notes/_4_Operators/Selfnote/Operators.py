Python Operators:
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Operators are special symbols in python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation
types of Operators:
1.Arithmetic operator(+,-,*, etc.)
2.Comparison operator(<,>,=, etc.)
3.Logical operator(and, or, not)
4.Bitwise operatorBitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers(|, &, etc.)
5.Assignment operator(==,+=, etc.)
6.Identity operator(is, is not)
7.Membership operators(in,not in)
"""
x = 3
y = 5

print(x * y)  # we use * operator for multiple of two values

"""
Arithmetic operator:
        Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations.
(+,-,*, etc.)"""
x = 7
y = 8
print(x + y)
print(x - y)
print(x * y)
print(x / y)
print(x % y)

"""
Comparison operator:
 Comparison operators are used to compare two values.(<,>,=, etc.)
"""
x = 5
y = 6
print(x > y)
print(x < y)
print(x == y)
print(x != y)

"""
Logical operator:
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements(and, or, not)
"""
