"""
Token:
    THE smallest individual unit of python program is known as " TOKEN ".

There are following tokens in Python:
identifiers     operator              literals          Keywords    constant    puntuators

Identifier(Names):
        A python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function,class,module or other object.
in  write operation, L.H.S is Identifier.
Identifier must and should use only alpha,numeric and underscore(_).
1. 1st letter starts _(underscore) or letters (lowercase)
2. Don't use numbers
3. Don't use keywords ,special symbols

Operators:
Operators are special symbols in python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation
types of Operators:
1.Arithmetic operator(+,-,*, etc.)
2.Comparison operator(<,>,=, etc.)
3.Logical operator(and, or, not)
4.Bitwise operator(|, &, etc.)
5.Assignment operator(==,+=, etc.)
6.Identity operator(is, is not)
7.Membership operators(in,not in)



Literals:
Literal is a raw data given in a variable or constant.
Types of Literals:
1.Numeric Literal-(int,float,complex)
2.String Literal-(str)
3.Boolean Literal-(True,False)
4.Special Literals-(None)
5.Literal Collections-(List Literals,Tuple Literals, Dict Literals and Set Literals)


Keywords:
Keyword are Reserved Word.
Keyword are pre-defined word.
Each keyword have particular task.
For normal, we won't use these keywords.



False               class               from                or
None                continue            global              pass
True                def                 if                  raise
and                 del                 import              return
as                  elif                in                  try
assert              else                is                  while
async               except              lambda              with
await               finally             nonlocal            yield
break               for                 not

Punctuators:
Punctuator are symbols that are used in Programming languages to organize sentence and program structure.
Most common puntuators of python program are:
'  " # \  () {}  [] @ , ; : .


Constants
A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed. It is helpful to think of constants as containers
that hold information which cannot be changed later.
Non-technically, you can think of constant as a bag to store some books and those books cannot be replaced
once placed inside the bag.
Assigning value to a constant in Python:
age = 10   # variable
PI = 3.14   22/7 # PI constant
GRAVITY  =  9.8    # GRAVITY is a constant
WEEKS = {MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN}


"""

x = 25
"""
x - identifier
= - operator
25 = literal
"""
PI = 3.14
# PI constant

print(x)  # here () are puntuators
