python Variable:
In python,Variables are containers for storing data values
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it .
A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values.
In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing.
Every value in Python has a datatype.
python has no command to declaring a variable
x = 100
here "x" is variable
" = " is operator
" 100 " is value

process of value allocate:

step-1: Load the statement

step-2: Execution starts from R.H.S = L.H.S

step-3: In R.H.S ,finds the type of data like int, float, boolean, str

step-4: If any expression , it performs the operation.final value, 
it converts final value into binary format

step-5: Binary value will be allocated some memory

step-6: Memory address will be referred to variable
this is write operation or create operation

Read operation:
step-1: python will go to the variable referred  address.
step-2: it will load the binary value of that address.
step-3: convert to decimal value.
