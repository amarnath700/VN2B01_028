OOPs stands for representing the Object-Oriented Programming system.
Programs are treated as a collection of objects in oops. Each object is nothing but an example of a class.

. Why use OOPs?
OOPs, has clarity in programming. It has flexibility and simplicity in solving complex problems.
Re-usage of code is easy as Inheritance concept helps to reduce redundancy of code.
Data and code are bound together by encapsulation. OOPs has features for data hiding, so private data can be store
and maintain confidentiality. Problems can be divided into different parts making it simple to solve.
The concept of polymorphism has flexibility for that a single entity can have multiple forms.

It consists of methods ( set of instructions) which are performed on the objects.

Structure: A structure is also a user-defined collection of variables. Structures are also different data types.

C++
Visual Basic . NET.
Ruby
Scala
PHP
